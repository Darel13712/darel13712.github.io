What do we actually know about copyright and piracy from research?
We have the system in place, but does it even work?
Does it spurs creativity, helps authors earn more or is it for corporations profits only?

### [Estimating displacement rates of copyrighted content in the EU](https://juliareda.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/displacement_study.pdf)

This study aims to answer the following two main research questions:

1. How do online copyright infringements affect sales of copyrighted content?
2. How much are online copyright infringers willing to pay for copyrighted
content? 

- In 2014, on average **51 per cent of the adults and 72 per cent of the minors**
  in the EU have illegally downloaded or streamed any form of creative content
  
- In general, the results **do not show** robust statistical evidence of
  displacement of sales by online copyright infringements ... An exception is
  the displacement of recent top films.
  
- The study also analysed consumers’ “willingness to pay” for illegally accessed
 creative content in order to assess whether piracy might be related to price
 levels. 
 Overall, the analysis indicates that for films and TV-series current 
 prices are higher than 80 per cent of the illegal downloaders and streamers are willing to pay. 
 For books, music and games prices are at a level broadly corresponding to the willingness to pay of 
 illegal downloaders and streamers. This suggests that a
 decrease in the price level would not change piracy rates for books, music and
 games but that prices can have an effect on displacement rates for films and
 TV-series. 
 
- Overall, the price is one factor that helps explain the piracy of films and TVseries,
  but the price does not help explain the piracy of music, e-books and
  games. 
 
#### Music
- **In the music industry, live concerts generate more revenues than recorded
music – physical carriers, digital streams and downloads combined.** Sales of
recorded music have shifted from physical carriers (CDs, vinyl records) to
paid streams and subscription services since 2009. This is particularly the
case in Sweden, home country of Spotify, a popular music stream service. 

- Three previous studies with robust findings for music reported small but
  significant displacement rates of around 10 per cent. However, these previous
  studies do not include effects on live music concerts, and this is exactly where
  this study and one previous study (Dang Nguyen et al., 2012) find a
  significantly positive effect of illegal streams. 

- For music, the **estimated overall displacement rate is zero**. 
The displacement of physical sales (though with a large error margin) 
is compensated by a significant positive effect of illegal downloads and streams on live concert visits. 

#### Movies
   
- For audio-visual material, the box office (cinema) and physical carriers (DVD /
  Blu-Ray) are still the most important sales channels. Total sales have declined
  in three out of the six countries in this study (France, Spain and the United
  Kingdom). Higher online sales did not compensate for the decline of sales via
  physical carriers and the industry does not expect this to change in the near
  future. 
  
- For films or TV-series, every 100 illegal streams or downloads are estimated
  to displace 27 legal transactions (online or offline). 
  
- The (statistically significant) estimated displacement rate is 40 per cent for films. 

- The low willingness to pay any price suggests that if the film or
TV-series were no longer illegally available, **they would not have downloaded**
the film or TV-series from a pay site. 
  
#### Books
  
- People seem willing to download
  or stream books legally but do so illegally because **the book is not available
  online on legal sites**, or to save out the money they would in fact have been
  willing to spend. 
 
- For books, the reported **number of illegal streams is negligible**. The estimated
  displacement rate of illegal book downloads is insignificant. 
  
#### Games
  
- **For games, the estimated effect of illegal online transactions on sales is
  positive** – implying that illegal consumption leads to increased legal
  consumption. This positive effect of illegal downloads and streams on the
  sales of games may be explained by the industry being successful in
  converting illegal users to paying users. Tactics used by the industry include,
  for example, offering gameplay with extra bonuses or extra levels if
  consumers pay. 
  
- Interestingly, the only available previous study analysing effects of illegal
  downloads on games also reported **significant positive effects** (Bastard et al.,
  2012). 
  
- For games, the estimated effect of illegal online transactions on sales is
  positive because only free games are more likely displaced by online copyright
  infringements than not. The **overall estimate is 24 extra legal transactions
  (including free games) for every 100 online copyright infringements**, with an
  error margin of 45 per cent (two times the standard error). The positive effect
  of illegal downloads and streams on the sales of games may be explained by
  players getting hooked and then paying to play the game with extra bonuses
  or at extra levels.
